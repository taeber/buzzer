                                     Buzzer

Buzzer is a microblogging service written in Go on which users socialize by
posting messages known as "buzzes". Registered users can subscribe to another
users posts which appear on their "buzz-feed" along with any message in which
they were mentioned (@username). Additionally, anyone can search for messages
by tags (#topic).

Buzzer uses Go's channels and goroutines to coordinate the asynchronous
activity and exposes the service via a WebSockets-based API for real-time,
bidirectional communication with a minimal web client.

Buzzer will be written solely by Taeber Rapczak <taeber@ufl.edu> for his
COP5618 Spring 2019 class project to demonstrate the effectiveness of Go's
implementation of ideas from Sir Tony Hoare's 1978 CSP paper.
