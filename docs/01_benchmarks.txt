First, I have to point out that the Go team has done a wonderful thing here
by not only including a testing library, but integrating a test runner, code
coverage tool, and benchmarker into the tools suite.

Second, it looks like the overhead of using channels is quite large. Where
posting using the non-concurrent server takes 394 ns, using the channels-based
server takes 69059 ns on average!

I suspect, however, that the network latency will be more of a bottleneck than
any of the on-server operations. In other words, the incurred overhead will be
neglible to the end users.
